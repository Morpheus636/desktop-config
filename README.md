# Desktop Config
A set of configuration files (dotfiles) and shell scripts for setting up my desktop OS installations. Written for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

You're welcome to use this repo as a starting point for your own install scripts.

# Usage
__WARNING__ Only `setup.sh` should be run on it's own,. 
Other scripts in this directory are run automatically by `setup.sh` and could cause problems if manually run.

1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop. Minimal edition should work fine.
2. Download this repository to somewhere in your user directory. `~/Documents` works well.
3. `cd` into the directory
4. OPTIONAL
    - Place an OpenVPN config file (certs must be included in the file) called `client.ovpn` in the `config` directory
    OpenVPN configuration will just be skipped if the file does not exist.
    - 
5. `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
6. `sudo ./setup.sh $USER`

## Post-Script Manual Configuration
Some changes cannot be made by the script due to limitations of the software involved, or authentication requirements. 

You will need to do the following manually:
- Sign into Chrome. It should sync your config from other devices manually
- Sign into VSCode using your Microsoft account and enable sync.
- Sign into PyCharm with your jetbrains account.
