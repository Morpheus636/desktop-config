# Desktop Config
A set of configuration files and shell scripts for setting up my desktop OS installations. Written for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

You're welcome to use this repo as a starting point for your own install scripts. 

Releases that are not marked as pre-releases should be considered stable, but nothing in this repository comes with any warranty,
implied or otherwise (see the license and copyright notice for more).

# Usage
1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop. Minimal edition should work fine.
2. Download this repository to somewhere in your user directory. `~/Documents` works well.
3. `cd` into the directory
4. OPTIONAL
    - Place an OpenVPN config file (certs must be included in the file) called `client.ovpn` in the `./assets/config/` directory
    OpenVPN configuration will just be skipped if the file does not exist.
5. `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
6. `sudo ./setup.sh $USER`

To update configuration later on after changes in the git repo, run `sudo ./user-config.sh $USER`.

## Post-Script Manual Configuration
Some changes cannot be made by the script due to limitations of the software involved, or authentication requirements. 

You will need to do the following manually:
- Sign into Chrome. It should sync your config from other devices manually
- Sign into VSCode using your Microsoft account and enable sync.
- Sign into PyCharm with your jetbrains account.
- Sign into Telegram

## Scripts/Modules
### setup.sh
The only script which should be run manually. 

This runs all the other scripts.

It should be run with sudo, and passed a username as the first argument.

# Development Utilities
The `./dev_tools/` directory contains scripts used to streamline development.
None of them should be run by sudo, and they are all documented within themselves. For information on any of them, run `<scriptpath> --help`.
