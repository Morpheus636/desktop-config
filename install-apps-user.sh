#
# Functions must NOT be run as sudo to work properly. The script takes no arguments.
#
# Dependencies may be missing if you haven't run the install-apps-sudo script 
# (or setup.sh, which runs it automatically) already on this system, since this
# script depends on programs that were installed by install-apps-sudo Everything 
# works properly when run together in ./setup.sh.
