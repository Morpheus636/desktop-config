# You can `source` this file to execute individual functions in it, but you need
# to have your working directory set to the root of the repo, and you need to
# pass $USER as an arg when you `source` it.

# Dependencies may be missing if you haven't run this script (or setup.sh, which
# runs this script automatically) already on this system. Run the install_deps
# function from install-apps.sh before running any other functions to prevent this.

# Functions must be run as sudo to work properly.

# Ensure you run `sudo chown -R <username> /home/<username>` after you run functions
# To prevent files in your home directory from being owned by root.
